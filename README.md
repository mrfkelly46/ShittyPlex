Provides a basic web interface to view, filter, and sort movies available on a local media server.

The MySQL DB is populated using a set of python scripts (not in this repo) that scrapes the Movies folder and uses the [OMDb API](https://www.omdbapi.com) to collect movie information.

In cases where the movie is an MP4, it provides a link to stream the movie in Chrome with the help of the ['Enable local file links'](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/enable-local-file-links/nikfmfgobenbhmocjaaboihbeocackld) chrome extension.
