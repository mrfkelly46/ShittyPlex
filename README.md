# ShittyPlex

Provides a basic web interface to view, filter, and sort movies available on the local media server. MySQL DB populated with a set of python scripts (not in this repo) that scrapes the Movies folder for information.

In cases where the movie is an MP4, provides a link to stream in Chrome with the help of the ['Enable local file links'](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/enable-local-file-links/nikfmfgobenbhmocjaaboihbeocackld) extension.
