store original location/cleaned location for every movie,
then,
whenever we check a file we can look to see if we have already added it in the past.

Cases:
  new torrent:  gross.file.name.mp4 will not be in DB, call process to add it a 'dirty' movie
  new clean movie (put in manually): (YYYY) Clean Movie.mp4 will not be in DB, call process to add 'clean' movie (og location==cleaned location)
  see old torrent:  gross.file.name.mp4 in DB, just check for updates -- no editing files.
  see old clean torrent/symlink:  in DB as either og or cleaned or both, check for updates

store last-checked and only check for updates on monday mornings?
